This paper presents a binary linear program for the Minimum Cost Subgraph Matching (MCSM) problem. MCSM is an extension of the subgraph isomorphism problem where the matching tolerates substitutions of attributes and modifications of the graph structure. The objective function proposed in the formulation can take into account rich attributes (e.g. vectors mixing nominal and numerical values) on both vertices and edges. Some experimental results obtained on an application-dependent dataset concerning the spotting of symbols on technical drawings show that the approach obtains better performance than a previous approach which is only substitution-tolerant.
