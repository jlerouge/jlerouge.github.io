The work conducted in this article presents a
structural signature based on texture for the characterization and
categorization of digitized historical book pages. The proposed
signature does not assume a priori knowledge regarding page
layout and content, and hence, it is applicable to a large variety
of ancient books. By integrating varying low-level features (e.g.
texture) characterizing the different page components (i.e. different
text fonts or graphic regions) on the one hand, and structural
information describing the page layout on the other hand, the
proposed signature provides a rich and holistic description of the
layout and content of the analyzed book pages. More precisely, the
signature-based characterization approach consists of two stages.
The first stage is extracting automatically homogeneous regions.
Then, the second one is proposing a graph-based page signature,
which is based on the extracted homogeneous regions, reflecting
its layout and content. This signature ensures the implementation
of numerous applications for managing effectively a corpus or
collections of books (e.g. information retrieval in digital libraries
according to several criteria or page categorization). To illustrate
the effectiveness of the proposed page signature, a detailed
experimental evaluation has been conducted in this article for
assessing two possible categorization applications, unsupervised
page classification and page stream segmentation.
